# SagePort: A Zk STARK Blockchain
SagePort is an open-source blockchain implementation based on Zk STARK technology, designed to provide scalable, transparent, and privacy-enhanced transactions within a decentralized network. It leverages the power of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (Zk STARKs) to achieve efficient and secure transaction verification without revealing sensitive information.

# Key Features
Scalability: SagePort addresses the scalability challenges of traditional blockchain networks by utilizing Zk STARKs, enabling a higher transaction throughput without compromising security.
Transparency: All transactions on SagePort are transparent and verifiable, ensuring a trustless environment for participants. The blockchain's immutability and transparency contribute to increased accountability and auditability.
Privacy: SagePort integrates privacy-enhancing mechanisms enabled by Zk STARKs, allowing users to conduct confidential transactions without exposing sensitive data to the public blockchain. The use of Zero-Knowledge proofs ensures transaction privacy while maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.
Smart Contract Capabilities: SagePort is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), providing support for smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Developers can leverage the power of smart contracts to build decentralized applications on the SagePort blockchain.
# How Zk STARK Works
SagePort employs Zk STARKs to achieve privacy-preserving transaction verification. Zk STARKs enable the blockchain network to verify the validity of transactions without revealing the transaction details or compromising the integrity of the blockchain. The process involves generating Zero-Knowledge proofs, which are succinct and non-interactive, providing a means to validate transactions while preserving privacy. Zk STARKs serve as cryptographic evidence that transactions are valid without revealing any confidential information.
